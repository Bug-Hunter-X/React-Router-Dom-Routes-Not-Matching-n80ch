# React Router Dom Routes Not Matching

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom: routes failing to match even with seemingly correct configurations.  The problem is likely due to a subtle error in the route definition, or a conflict with other parts of the application.

The `App.js` file showcases the buggy implementation. The solution is presented in `AppSolution.js`, fixing the issue.  This example will help developers quickly identify and resolve similar problems in their projects.
